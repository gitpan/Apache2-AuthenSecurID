Crypt::Blowfish and Authen::ACE. 

Installation as usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

There are support files for Redhat-based systems in the redhat directory.

NAME
    Apache2::AuthenSecurID - Authentication via a SecurID server

SYNOPSIS
     # Configuration in httpd.conf or access.conf 

    PerlModule Apache2::AuthenSecurID

    <Location /secure/directory> AuthName SecurID AuthType Basic

     PerlAuthenHandler Apache2::AuthenSecurID

     PerlSetVar AuthCryptKey Encryption_Key 
     PerlSetVar AuthCookie Name_of_Authentication_Cookie 
     PerlSetVar AuthUserCookie Name_of_Username_Authentication_Cookie 
     PerlSetVar AuthCookiePath /path/of/authentication/cookie
     PerlSetVar AuthCookieTimeOut 30 
     PerlSetVar Auth_Handler /path/of/authentication/handler

     require valid-user
    </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows authentication against a SecurID server. It detects
    whether a user has a valid encrypted cookie containing their username
    and last activity time stamp. If the cookie is valid the module will
    change the activity timestamp to the present time, encrypt and send the
    cookie. If the cookie is not valid the module will redirect to the
    authentication handler to prompt for username and passcode.

LIST OF TOKENS
    * AuthCryptKey
    The Blowfish key used to encrypt and decrypt the authentication cookie.
    It defaults to my secret if this variable is not set.

    * AuthCookie
    The name of the of cookie to be set for the authentication token. It
    defaults to SecurID if this variable is not set.

    * AuthUserCookie
    The name of the of cookie that contains the value of the persons
    username in plain text. This is checked against the contents of the
    encrypted cookie to verify user. The cookie is set of other applications
    can identify authorized users. It defaults to SecurID_User if this
    variable is not set.

    * AuthCookiePath
    The path of the of cookie to be set for the authentication token. It
    defaults to / if this variable is not set.

    * AuthCookieTimeOut
    The time in minute a cookie is valid for. It is not recommended to set
    below 5. It defaults to 30 if this variable is not set.

    * Auth_Handler
    The path of authentication handler. This is the URL which request with
    invalid cookie are redirected to. The handler will prompt for username
    and passcode. It does the actual authentication and sets the initial
    cookie. This mechanism is used instead of get_basic_auth_pw because
    get_basic_auth_pw will do multiple authentication attempt on pages that
    contain frames. The ACE server will deny simultaneous authentication
    attempts since it considers this a type of attack. It defaults to
    /ace_init if this variable is not set. Please see
    Apache2::AuthenSecurID::Auth to properly configure this functionality.

CONFIGURATION
    The module should be loaded upon startup of the Apache daemon. Add the
    following line to your httpd.conf:

     PerlModule Apache2::AuthenSecurID

PREREQUISITES
    For AuthenSecurID you need to enable the appropriate call-back hook when
    making mod_perl:

      perl Makefile.PL PERL_AUTHEN=1

    AuthenSecurID requires Crypt::Blowfish and Crypt::CBC.

    Apache2::AuthenSecurID::Auth - Authentication handler for

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows authentication against a SecurID server. A request is
    redirected to this handler if the authentication cookie does not exist
    or is no longer valid. The handler will prompt for username and
    passcode. It will then construct and encrypt a UDP packet and send it to
    the Ace request daemon. This is necessary since libsdiclient.a needs to
    persist for NEXT TOKEN MODE and SET PIN MODE. If the authentication is
    valid an encrypted Authentication Cookie is set and the request is
    redirected to the originating URI. If the user needs to enter NEXT TOKEN
    or set their PIN they will be prompted to do so and if valid the request
    is then redirected to the originating URI.

LIST OF TOKENS
    * AuthCryptKey
    The Blowfish key used to encrypt and decrypt the authentication cookie.
    It defaults to my secret if this variable is not set.

    * AuthCookie
    The name of the of cookie to be set for the authentication token. It
    defaults to SecurID if this variable is not set.

    * AuthUserCookie
    The name of the of cookie that contains the value of the persons
    username in plain text. This is checked against the contents of the
    encrypted cookie to verify user. The cookie is set of other applications
    can identify authorized users. It defaults to SecurID_User if this
    variable is not set.

    * AuthCookiePath
    The path of the of cookie to be set for the authentication token. It
    defaults to / if this variable is not set.

    * AuthApacheCookie
    The name of the mod_usertrack cookie. The mod_usertrack module must be
    compile and enabled in order to track user sessions. This is set by the
    CookieName directive in httpd.conf. It defaults to Apache if this
    variable is not set.

    * ace_initd_server
    The name of the server running the ACE request daemon. This daemon is
    the actual process that communicates with the ACE Server. If the user is
    in NEXT TOKEN MODE due to repeated failures or SET PIN MODE the
    Authen::ACE object must persist beyond the initial request. A request
    packet is constructed with a random number, type of transaction,
    username, passcode and session identifier. The request packet is then
    encrypted using Blowfish and sent to the ACE request daemon. The ACE
    request daemon decrypts and parses the packet. The request if forwarded
    to the ACE server and the response is sent back to the handler. The
    random number originally sent is returned to prevent attacks. It
    defaults to localhost if this variable is not set.

    * ace_initd_port
    The port the that the Ace request daemon listens on. It defaults to 1969
    if this variable is not set.

CONFIGURATION
    The module should be loaded upon startup of the Apache daemon. Add the
    following line to your httpd.conf:

     PerlModule Apache2::AuthenSecurID::Auth

PREREQUISITES
    For AuthenSecurID::Auth you need to enable the appropriate call-back
    hook when making mod_perl:

      perl Makefile.PL PERL_AUTHEN=1

    AuthenSecurID::Auth requires Crypt::Blowfish and Crypt::CBC.

    For AuthenSecurID::Auth to properly track users mod_usertrack must be
    compiled and enabled.

NAME
    ace_initd - ACE Authentication daemon for Apache::AuthenSecurID::Auth

SYNOPSIS
    nohup ./ace_initd --listen=127.0.0.1 --facility=local2 --secret=123456
    --port=1969 --var_ace=/var/ace

DESCRIPTION
    This daemon handles the ACE authentication requests for the
    Apache::SecurID::Auth module. It is a single threaded, single fork
    server that listens on a specified UDP port. Incoming requests are
    decrypted and requests forwarded to the ACE server. If a specific
    request is in either in NEXT TOKEN MODE or SET PIN MODE the Authen::ACE
    object is not deleted. It is instead kept in memory to handle those
    specific requests later.

LIST OF TOKENS
    * --var_ace
    Specifies the location of the sdconf.rec file. It defaults to
    $ENV{VAR_ACE} if this variable is not set.

    * --secret
    The Blowfish key used to encrypt and decrypt the authentication cookie.
    It defaults to my secret if this variable is not set.

    * --port
    The port the that the Ace request daemon listens on. It defaults to 1969
    if this variable is not set.

    * --facility
    The syslog facility ace_initd logs to. It defaults to local2 if this
    variable is not set.

    * --daemon
    Break off from the shell and become a daemon.

CONFIGURATION
    Either run from the command line;

    prompt$ nohup ./ace_initd &

    or write the appropriate scripts in the /etc/rc directories.

PREREQUISITES
    ace_initd requires Crypt::Blowfish, Crypt::CBC and Authen::ACE.
